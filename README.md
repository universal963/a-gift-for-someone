# a-gift-for-someone
This is a little place for my secret gift, anyone who is interested is appreciated to give me a favor. 
At present it is only a batch file for Windows(DOS and Win9x/Me is not supported, which means it is not intended for these systems). Maybe later I will write a shell file, and/or make another one using Twine.
